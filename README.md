# Currency Converter React App

A simple React-based currency converter that allows users to input an amount, select the currencies to convert from and to, and see the converted amount in real-time. The app uses predefined exchange rates and demonstrates React hooks like `useState` and `useMemo` for optimized calculations.

---

## Features

- Input field to accept numerical amounts.
- Two dropdowns to select currencies (`USD`, `EUR`, `GBP`, `JPY`).
- Conversion calculation updates when changing the "from" currency.
- Changing the "to" currency updates the displayed result without recalculating the base conversion.
- Rounded display of the converted amount to two decimal places.
- Clear, minimal, and personal styling.

---

## How It Works

- The user enters an amount.
- Selects the "from" currency, which triggers the conversion calculation (memoized for efficiency).
- Selects the "to" currency, which updates the displayed converted amount based on the current calculation.
- The conversion uses predefined exchange rates, e.g., `USD: 1`, `EUR: 0.92`, `GBP: 0.78`, `JPY: 156.7`.

## Setup

### Prerequisites

- Modern web browser
- Basic knowledge of React and JavaScript

### Development Environment

This project uses CDN links for React, ReactDOM, and Babel, so no local setup is required.

### Usage

1. Save the `CurrencyConverter` component code into your project, e.g., `index.jsx`.
2. Include it in your main HTML file:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <title>Currency Converter</title>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/18.3.1/umd/react.development.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/18.3.1/umd/react-dom.development.min.js"></script>
  <script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/7.26.5/babel.min.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
  <!-- Import your JSX file with Babel -->
  <script type="text/babel" src="index.jsx"></script>
  <script type="text/babel">
    ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root')).render(<CurrencyConverter />);
  </script>
</body>
</html>
``

3. Open the HTML file in your browser. The currency converter should be functional!
